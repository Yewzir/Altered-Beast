# Altered Beast

<p align="justify">
  Altered Beast is a two-dimensional platformer video game originally developed by Sega Corporation
  in 1988. It involves an average shaped male, hereinafter referred to as "Hero", who needs to progress
  in increasingly difficult levels, each with their own collection of (recurring) enemies. The Hero
  may encounter several objects on his path, some of which grant transformations into stronger
  versions of himself. Ultimately, when the Hero manages to gain a streak of colliding with three
  power-ups, he will morph into a mighty creature, only this time it ain't so average shaped...

  The project in my repository showcases the transforming effects of power-ups on the Hero, as
  seen in the original game. All graphical content is copyrighted and property of Sega Corporation

  Studio and Adobe Photoshop, and was backed by the Windows API.
